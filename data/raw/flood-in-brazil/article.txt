Flood in Brazil
A storm hit the Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil on 29 April.
Torrential rains poured down across 76 cities, resulting in mass flooding. 5 deaths were reported, many injured and 18 people missing. Nearly 100 residents were forced to evacuate their homes, and an additional 200 sought refuge in shelters.
Heavy rains lead to the Barramansa River bursting its banks and flooding local roads, the overflowed water collided with a bridge's foundations and completely detached it from the road.
