Flood in Brazil
Heavy rain caused flooding in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Officials stated the rate of rainfall - as much as 655 millimeters in 48 hours - was record-breaking for the region.
At least 16 casualties were reported, in Angra dos Reis, Paraty, and Mesquita.
In Angra dos Reis, a landslide destroyed several homes leaving eight dead. Ilha Grande was also affected badly, where landslides hit several areas and Praia de Itaguaçu was submerged.
A state of emergency was declared on 2 April, and first responders began a search in the affected areas. Landslides made this difficult in some locations, as roads were blocked by debris.
