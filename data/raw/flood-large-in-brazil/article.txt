Flooding in Brazil
Approximately two months after being hit by an
extratropical cyclone
, Vale do Taquari in Rio Grande do Sul, was once again affected by storms and floods.
On Saturday 18 November 2023, the Taquari River burst its banks, causing flooding in the streets of cities in the region.
People residing in risk areas were requested to take preventive measures in advance and contact the Civil Defense of their municipality in case of emergency.
In September, an extratropical cyclone passed through Rio Grande do Sul and left 50 people dead in the state. Vale do Taquari was the most affected region, with 16 deaths in the city of Muçum and 13 deaths in Roca Sales alone.
